-----
(1) Files submitted to the correct folder and named appropriately; compiles
without errors or warnings.

- Yes, the submitted files are correct, and the code
  compiles and runs successfully without errors or warnings.

-----
(2) Tests passed (and further comments)

- All tests passed. Great work.

-----
(3) Code formatting and structure:

Positive aspects:

- Good formatting and structure of the code that facilitates reading
  and understanding.

- Good naming conventions for functions and variables.

- Good attempt at documenting the code using comments to describe
  important aspects of the solution.

- Appropriate use of code segmentation (i.e. function creation and
  use) that facilitates the usability and eventual maintainability of
  your solution.

- Appropriate use of dynamic memory allocation to define relevant data structures.

Improvement opportunities:

- Instead of having large functions, it is a good practice to divide
  your program into small pieces of functionality defined in
  well-defined functions. Functions should have a unique intention and a
  very clear scope. This facilitates the re-usability and maintainability
  of your code.

- It is always a good idea to check if a file was successfully opened after using fopen.
